# Api Gateway for Testbusters

Testbusters is a company that provides a series of services to help students prepare for their exams. They have a series of verticals that are built on top of WordPress. They contacted F.Technology to develop a gateway that would connect all the verticals to a single API.

## The challenge

We had to design a resilient and scalable API gateway that would connect all the verticals to a single API. The gateway had to be able to handle a large number of requests and be able to scale horizontally.
